    "- **Can we do more examples like the spam baseline question? I was confused with the baseline answer. I want to be able to understand this \"neither\" way of thinking for more scenarios.**\n",
    "    - yep, we will have more examples\n",
    "    - generally speaking, you need to check how frequently each class label occurs in your dataset\n",
    "    - the fraction of points that belong to the most frequent class is your baseline\n",
    "    - e.g., if 90% of your email are fine, and 10% are spam, your baseline accuracy is 90%\n",
    "    - if you were to predict 'no spam' to each email, you would be correct 90% of the time\n",
    "    - so a classifier is good if it's accuracy is better than the baseline\n",
    "- **I was wondering what are some of the best practices that should be applied to Exploratory Data Analysis (especially for large datasets)?**\n",
    "    - we will cover a couple of things during the next two lectures\n",
    "    - summary stats for each column is a great way to start\n",
    "    - figures for each column\n",
    "    - create a correlation coefficient matrix\n",
    "    - ceheck how strongly each feature correlates with the target variable\n",
    "- **Is the model the same as the parameter?**\n",
    "    - nope, models have parameters\n",
    "- **Will you further explain the different packages that we will be importing and using to create these models?**\n",
    "    - yes, we cover pandas today and next Tuesday for example\n",
    "- **The muddiest part of this lecture was how to go about splitting a dataset and how to choose an evaluation metric.**\n",
    "    - we will spend a week on each of those topics\n",
    "- **\"The sampling, what difference between curly X and X is, and what is S?**\n",
    "    - curly X is the domain set so all possible values of your features. If a data point is described by let's say d features, it could be a set of d dimensional real numbers\n",
    "    - X is sampled from curly X\n",
    "    - S is your training set which contains feature vectors (x_i) and and a true target variable (y_i)\n",
    "    - Check out chapter 2 of [this book](https://bruknow.library.brown.edu/permalink/01BU_INST/9mvq88/alma991027787129706966) for more info\n",
    "- **How do we define a \"large\" dataset? How many observations?**\n",
    "    - there is no clear answer to these types of questions\n",
    "    - some people would consider more than 10k points large, others might consider a dataset with more than 10m points to be large\n",
    "- **How does a model determine the Y target variable value on the decision boundary?**\n",
    "    - it could be random choice, one could return the most frequently occuring label in the training set, there might be other reasonable approaches too\n",
    "- **Were we expected to understand the pipeline or was this just an overview that we will dive into later?**\n",
    "    - Yep, it was just an overview and we will dive into each step later\n",
    "- **If you could explain more on the bias-variance tradeoff that would be great!**\n",
    "    - we will revisit it a couple of times during the term\n",
    "- **How did you determine the Cs in the example?**\n",
    "    - we will cover this later too\n",
    "    - some hyperparameters need to be uniformly spaced in log, other hyperparameters are linearly spaced\n",
    "    - we will learn how to decide\n",
    "- **I didn't quite fully follow the process of how we get the best C score. Do we just feed the C into the classifier, which is part of the packages I assume, and then use that classifier to predict and then check the output?**\n",
    "    - yes but we tried 13 different values for C\n",
    "    - we need to decide which of them gave the best model\n",
    "- **I'm a bit confused about whether the generalization error is calculated from the train set or the test set?**\n",
    "    - test set, always the test set\n",
    "    - the only purpose of the test set is to calculate the generalization error\n",
    "- **The muddiest part was hyper parameters. Could you please elaborate on what they are?**\n",
    "    - we will spend two weeks on them around mid-October"

    "## The steps\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: you need to understand your data and verify that it doesn't contain errors</span>\n",
    "   - do as much EDA as you can!\n",
    "    \n",
    "**2. Split the data into different sets**: most often the sets are train, validation, and test (or holdout)\n",
    "   - practitioners often make errors in this step!\n",
    "   - you can split the data randomly, based on groups, based on time, or any other non-standard way if necessary to answer your ML question\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Preprocess the data**: ML models only work if X and Y are numbers! Some ML models additionally require each feature to have 0 mean and 1 standard deviation (standardized features)\n",
    "   - often the original features you get contain strings (for example a gender feature would contain 'male', 'female', 'non-binary', 'unknown') which needs to transformed into numbers\n",
    "   - often the features are not standardized (e.g., age is between 0 and 100) but it needs to be standardized\n",
    "    \n",
    "**4. Choose an evaluation metric**: depends on the priorities of the stakeholders\n",
    "   - often requires quite a bit of thinking and ethical considerations\n",
    "     \n",
    "**5. Choose one or more ML techniques**: it is highly recommended that you try multiple models\n",
    "   - start with simple models like linear or logistic regression\n",
    "   - try also more complex models like nearest neighbors, support vector machines, random forest, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**6. Tune the hyperparameters of your ML models (aka cross-validation)**\n",
    "   - ML techniques have hyperparameters that you need to optimize to achieve best performance\n",
    "   - for each ML model, decide which parameters to tune and what values to try\n",
    "   - loop through each parameter combination\n",
    "       - train one model for each parameter combination\n",
    "       - evaluate how well the model performs on the validation set\n",
    "   - take the parameter combo that gives the best validation score\n",
    "   - evaluate that model on the test set to report how well the model is expected to perform on previously unseen data\n",
    "    \n",
    "**7. Interpret your model**: black boxes are often not useful\n",
    "   - check if your model uses features that make sense (excellent tool for debugging)\n",
    "   - often model predictions are not enough, you need to be able to explain how the model arrived to a particular prediction (e.g., in health care)"
